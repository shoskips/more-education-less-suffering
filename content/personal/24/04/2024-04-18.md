Went to Montpellier with Claudia, sold lentils and leaned alot

Ive never seen people so free. I recall seeing many comrades, and different sides of them
They did not care, especially while high, about being someone else's object. Everyone was acting in an unfiltered way, the subject of their own warped reality.

I recall talking with sarrah, the girl who smellwd the coconut milk from minutes away. We had a very sobER conversation. I remember zoning out of the conversation because of how beautiful she was. Maybe if we were high, a different outcome would've manifested
