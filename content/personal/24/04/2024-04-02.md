omg its 8am!!

consuming the usual breakfast shit to ensure that this isnt a pseudo morning

felt bad for wanting to give the washing machine fizzy tablets to the homesless. maybe itll harm them

On the metro returning from judo
Gonna meet may tonight, the carrot girl
Glad that it wasn't a pseudo morning 
Gonna sleep well tonight, especially if I we have sex, double especially if we cuddle all night 

I feel for Rafa. His situation reminds me of my dad's, though aside from owing money, they're not that similar. I cannot belive his, and everyone else's, desensitization to capitalism. How a taxi app can take half of his wage.
