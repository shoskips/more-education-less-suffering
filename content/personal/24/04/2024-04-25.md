Last night I fell out with Paula. What a strange night blu√±oughhs

Basically, my mind was foggy, and we were intoxicated (her moreso I think, wit red wine)
While having sex for the second time - after getting back from the punky chino - I said she was lose, and she didn't take it well.
After asking me if she overreacted, and me responding yeah, she wouldn't 

She really projected onto me.
She said I should leave, because of all the mental health "I diagnosedvher with "

Have learned from this experience. And my overall experience with Paulina.
I think she is crazy and that it would be better to end things here (if they haven't already ended) 
I am aware that me may run into each other at some point in the future and I would be prepared for her to talk bad about me to someone if there was nothing else for her to talk about 

There were so many red flags that I ignored, and that i do not regret ignoring. One of, if not, the most, interesting person I've ever gotten to know. Completely decentralized from others in my life. A whirlwind 

I went into the sea and it was amazing. I plan to go every fucking morning
I felt an amazing burn and it was possible to swim for 30mins

Another amazing class at judo. I feel much better in general. I thought slot about what Paula has said.
It hurt my ego and I love it. Not sexually, just in terms of personal growth
