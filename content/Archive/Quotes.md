"If every ping-pong table had rackets,
Why would anyone steal them?
To sit on our shelves
To remind us who we are"

"I find the "capitalisation" of "I" very sinister" 

"An uncompromising punk isn't intelligent. Keep atleast one yuppie suit"

In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer - Camus

The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so abolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion - camus

“Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.” — Antonio Gramsci

Nina Simone said it’s an artists duty to reflect the times. No artist with a big platform that could have massive influence wants to reflect the times by speaking out. Most powerful artists in the world becoming spineless. people with smaller or no platform left pissing in the wind to try to spread awareness about these atrocities. It’s not right.

 "God blessed me by making me transsexual for the same reason God made wheat but not bread and fruit but not wine, so that humanity might share in the act of creation."

"Those who do not move will never notice the weight of their chains"

"You can't be neutral on a moving train"

'That’s all very well, some say, and anarchy may be a perfect form of human society, but we don’t want to take a leap in the dark. Tell us therefore in detail how your society will be organised. And there follows a whole series of questions, which are very interesting if we were involved in studying the problems that will impose themselves on the liberated society, but which are useless, or absurd, even ridiculous, if we are expected to provide definitive solutions.

What methods will be used to teach children? How will production be organised? Will there still be large cities, or will the population be evenly distributed over the whole surface of the earth? And supposing all the inhabitants of Siberia should want to spend the winter in Nice? And if everyone were to want to eat partridge and drink wine from the Chianti district? And who will do a miner’s job or be a seaman? And who will empty the privies? And will sick people be treated at home or in hospital? And who will establish the railway timetable? And what will be done if an engine-driver has a stomach-ache while the train is moving? ... And so on to the point of assuming that we have all the knowledge and experience of the unknown future, and that in the name of anarchy, we should prescribe for future generations at what time they must go to bed, and on what days they must pare their corns.

If indeed our readers expect a reply from us to these questions, or at least to those which are really serious and important, which is more than our personal opinion at this particular moment, it means that we have failed in our attempt to explain to them what anarchism is about.'

— Errico Malatesta, Anarchy, 1891
