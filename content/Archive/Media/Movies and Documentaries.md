Bold Native is a fiction feature film. Charlie Cranehill, an animal liberator wanted by the United States government for domestic terrorism, emerges from the underground to coordinate a nationwide action as his estranged CEO father tries to find him before the FBI does. The film simultaneously follows a young woman who works for an animal welfare organization fighting within the system to establish more humane treatment of farmed animals. From abolitionists to welfarists, Bold Native takes on the issue of modern animal use and exploitation from several angles within the context of a road movie adventure story. The filmmakers' background in documentary informed the creative approach to Bold Native. Self-financed and shot with a four person team in real-world locations, sometimes using real activists, lawyers, and formerly imprisoned animal liberators, the film weaves an intricate tale of one of the most important issues facing America and the world morally and ecologically -- the impact and consequences of industrialized animal use. And with a character who faces prosecution and potential lifetime imprisonment under the recently passed Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (AETA) for property crimes currently considered terrorism, the film also illuminates the danger of corporate interests influencing the law in a post-9/11 world.

Watch a secret history of destruction unfold by following the footsteps of a clandestine group of French computer workers. In 1980s Toulouse, an elusive group called ‘CLODO’ began bombing computer companies. They disappeared after three years, without ever being caught or ever to be heard of again. Two film makers launch an investigation into CLODO, looking for answers, motivations and identities, but are soon frustrated by a collective that struck in the dead of night, leaving in their tracks only ashes and the sporadic line of cryptic graffiti. The film combines archival traces, a viral desktop choreography, and late-night video recordings of CLODO’s targets into a meditation on computation, destruction, and the lure of archives.

![Living Utopia: Anarchism in the Spanish Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAEhRRDvHHQ&t=606s)

A thought-provoking documentary about the Spanish social revolution and the role of anarchism during that period

**The Spanish Revolution** was a workers’ social revolution that began at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and lasted for two to three years. During this period, anarchist and libertarian socialist organizational principles were implemented throughout various parts of the country, primarily in Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and the Valencian Community.

**Anarchist Principles** emphasized the conscious freedom of the individual and the natural duty of solidarity among human beings as an innate tool for the progress of societies. During the revolution, women achieved the right to abortion in Catalonia, the idea of consensual free love became popular, and there was a rise in naturism.

The documentary features interviews with 30 anarchist participants in the Spanish revolution, alongside footage captured at that time. The documentary provides a unique blend of historical account and personal experiences, offering a comprehensive understanding of the Spanish anarchist movement and its role in the revolution.

![Zone to defend, de Notre-Dame-des-Landes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhFJlKhMGDU)

**ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes** (also known as **ZAD NDDL**) is the most well-known '[Zone to Defend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_to_Defend "Zone to Defend")' in France. Located in the [Loire-Atlantique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loire-Atlantique "Loire-Atlantique") [department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France "Departments of France") near to [Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes "Nantes"), it is a very large, mostly agricultural terrain of 1,650 hectares (4,080 acres) which became nationally famous in the early 2010s and has resisted several concerted attempts by the French state to evict it.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZAD_de_Notre-Dame-des-Landes#cite_note-Willsher3-1)

For decades there was local resistance to plans to build a new airport in the rural [commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communes_of_France "Communes of France") of [Notre-Dame-des-Landes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame-des-Landes "Notre-Dame-des-Landes"). In the 2000s much of the land was squatted as farmers defied eviction. The new occupants set up autonomous self-sufficient structures such as a communal bakery and animal husbandry. Attempts to evict the squatters saw largescale counter-mobilisations in 2012 and 2018. French president [Emmanuel Macron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron "Emmanuel Macron") announced in January 2018 that the plans for the airport would be shelved and the already existing airport at Nantes would be redeveloped instead. Many of the remaining projects at the ZAD then engaged in a process of legalisation.
