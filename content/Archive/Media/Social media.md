*PRETEXT*
There are community based sites like Reddit and Discord, which can serve as an online family which (especially discord) ihelp to answer your being able to interact 

 I say this because I've noticed a lot of people opting out of disscusion, seeing it as a black and white thing, and that "we already agree, your preaching to the converted "

In general, your oppositions viewpoints so that you can deepen your understanding in order to point out the flaws in their logic, facts or their cryptic

Unfortunately, it's very easy to get caught up in bubbles that can narrow your perception, whether it's your friend's dinner or a gaming. chronically online communities can very quickly become an echo-chamber of ideas, downvoting into exile anyone who dares to mention an idea foreign to the circlejerk. This is with the assistance of an algorithm, 

Social media is wonderful place to passively learn and share information.
Though the depths of mindful content varies, content that gets the most engagement will always favoured, as afterall, [our attention is their product.](https://www.humanetech.com/youth/the-attention-economy#question-1) While subject to silicon valley's billion dollar research into how to make us beautifully irrational humans as addicted to their apps as possible, the most addictive, and often mindless, content will inevitably win our engagement, and be more forceably fed to us via the algorithm. 

Therefore, memes usually reign supreme. Although they can be funny, light on the mind and thought inspiring, the radicalization they bring through repetition is unhealthy and will likely lead to burn out.

While *knowing* is great, it doesn't bring much to real life in-and-of itself. The known thing essentially functions as a building block to a greater *understanding*, which is what really generates confidence and drives us to change our behaviours.

It should function as a firestarter of ideas and discussion, a primer to open minds. At the top I will put my favourites
