***Calling In vs. Out:*** Calling out is a public process of holding someone 
accountable with the hope that it will end their toxic behavior. In 
her article Calling IN: A Less Disposable Way of Holding Each Other 
Accountable,4 published on Black Girl Dangerous, Ngọc Loan Trần 
describes “calling in” as “a practice of pulling folks back in who 
have strayed from us. It means extending to ourselves the reality 
that we will and do fuck up, we stray, and there will always be 
a chance for us to return. Calling in as a practice of loving each 
other enough to allow each other to make mistakes, a practice of 
loving ourselves enough to know that what we’re trying to do here 
is a radical unlearning of everything we have been configured to 
believe is normal.”

***Emergence***
When a something becomes more than the sum of its parts.
A sustainable amount is to be found on the border between order and chaos
