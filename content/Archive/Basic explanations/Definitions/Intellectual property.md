Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names, and images used in commerce. It is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect. Intellectual property rights allow individuals and businesses to own and control the use of their creations, providing a way to profit from their ideas and innovations.

**Types of Intellectual Property**

There are several types of intellectual property, including:

- **Patents**: A patent is a legal right granted to an inventor for a new and useful invention. It gives the inventor the exclusive right to make, use, and sell the invention for a certain period of time.
- **Copyrights**: A copyright is a legal right granted to the creator of an original work, such as a book, song, or movie. It gives the creator the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display the work.
- **Trademarks**: A trademark is a symbol, word, or phrase that identifies a business or product. It is used to distinguish a business’s goods or services from those of another business.
- **Trade Secrets**: A trade secret is a confidential and valuable piece of information that is not publicly known. It can be a formula, process, or other type of information that gives a business a competitive advantage.

**Why is Intellectual Property Important?**

Intellectual property is important because it allows individuals and businesses to:

- **Protect their creations**: Intellectual property rights give creators the ability to protect their work and prevent others from using it without permission.
- **Monetize their ideas**: Intellectual property rights allow creators to profit from their ideas and innovations.
- **Encourage innovation**: Intellectual property rights provide an incentive for individuals and businesses to invest time and resources in creating new and innovative products and services.
- **Promote economic growth**: Intellectual property rights can contribute to economic growth by creating new jobs, industries, and opportunities for investment.

Hilarious, I know.

So, a phrase I like (i think I invented actually) is "common knowledge isn't common understandage"
What you think? Rolls off the tongue? No? Go fuck yourself. Oh what was that? Speak a little louder please. Oh, you've changed your mind? You brain has managed to wrap itself around this ever-so-densely pack quote. Watch it doesn't consume you like a black hole. 
Too bad, it's my intellectual property.

Imagine i was to tell you that only 5 people can listen to the beatles at any given time. Why only 5 people? Because, well, back in the golden days when the tvs where black and white and woman w

Where do we draw the line that divides copying and inspiration. 
That same line that divides stealing and expropriating

It seems to boil down to the [[Radical |root cause]] of individualism.

Even [the earth's richest person's ex-wife says "creating art is joining the conversation of all the other artists who came before you"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOwm7GUjcg8&t=961s). The continuous development of humanities *collective* creative capabilities is what defines us. It lasts forever, and permeates through every generation

I am aware of this and have been aware of this, that is why I don’t stress getting rich off of it, I tell people to download it if they want to and I sink any money I do make back into making more records…I am not ‘blaming fans,’ I’m stating facts…public discussion of specific instances of copyright infringement in my work is making it impossible to even create the music period, even if I were to give it away for free. It would still end up on YouTube and I’d still get served by Google-searching lawyers and publishing houses who think they might be able to squeeze money out of me.”
