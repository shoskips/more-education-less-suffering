Typically characterized by a [dictatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator "Dictator") leader, centralized [autocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy "Autocracy"), [militarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarism "Militarism"), forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural [social hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification "Social stratification"), subordination of [individual interests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism "Individualism") for the perceived good of the nation or race, and strong regimentation of society and the economy.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-Britannica-2)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-m-w-3)

Fascism rose to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-RoutledgeCompanion-4)[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEInternational_Encyclopedia_of_Political_Science887%E2%80%93888Fascism-5) The first fascist movements [emerged in Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism "Italian fascism") during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") before [spreading to other European countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_in_Europe "Fascism in Europe"), most notably [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-RoutledgeCompanion-4) Fascism also had adherents outside of [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEncyclopedia_Britannica_''Fascism''-6) Opposed to [anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism "Anarchism"), [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy "Democracy"), [pluralism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralism_(political_philosophy) "Pluralism (political philosophy)"), [liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism "Liberalism"), [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism"), and [Marxism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism"),[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEInternational_Encyclopedia_of_Political_Science889Fascism-7)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-USHMM-8) fascism is placed on the far-right wing within the traditional [left–right spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_political_spectrum "Left–right political spectrum").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-RoutledgeCompanion-4)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-USHMM-8)[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-University-Aristotle-Hartley-Wilhelm-Hawkesworth-9)

Fascists saw [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") as a [revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution "Revolution") that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of [total war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war "Total war") and the mass mobilization of society erased the distinction between civilians and combatants. A military citizenship arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlamires2006140%E2%80%93141,_670Mann200465-10) The war resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBlamires2006140%E2%80%93141,_670Mann200465-10)

Fascism rejects assertions that violence is inherently negative or pointless, instead viewing [imperialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism "Imperialism"), political violence, and war as means to national rejuvenation.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGr%C4%8Di%C4%872000120GriffinFeldman2004c185Spielvogel2012935Payne1995106-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTERietbergen2000160%E2%80%93161-12) Fascists often advocate for the establishment of a [totalitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism "Totalitarianism") [one-party state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state "One-party state"),[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGriffin20131%E2%80%936-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMussolini200240-14) and for a [dirigiste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirigisme "Dirigisme")[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-15)[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-16) economy, with the principal goal of achieving [autarky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky "Autarky") (national economic self-sufficiency) through [economic interventionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionist "Economic interventionist") policies. Fascism's extreme authoritarianism and nationalism often manifest as a belief in [racial purity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_purity "Racial purity") or a [master race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_race "Master race"), usually blended with some variant of [racism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism "Racism") or [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination "Discrimination") against a demonized "[Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy) "Other (philosophy)")", such as [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews "Jews"), [homosexuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality "Homosexuality"), [ethnic minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group "Minority group") or [immigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration "Immigration"). These ideas have motivated fascist regimes to commit [massacres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre "Massacre"), [forced sterilizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_sterilizations "Forced sterilizations"), [deportations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation "Deportation"), and [genocides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide").[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKallis2011Paxton1998Lancaster2011-17) During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the actions of the fascist [Axis powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers "Axis powers"), with their genocidal and imperialist ambitions, caused the death of millions of people.!


Mussolini (aka italian hitler) once said that “Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power.”

Some mussolini quotes that I had to tripple check were real

I'm not concerned with the legitamacy of these quotes, because
a) he killed many people
and
b) the quotes are still used as the basis of pro-domination argumentation, and upvoted by the seeds he sowed [(on this rEputAble source i got these quotes from)](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/221166.Benito_Mussolini)


“Every anarchist is a baffled dictator.”  
― Benito Mussolini

Anarchists emphasize the entanglement of the ends (communism) with the means (revolution). They argue that (most notably) the steate can't be used to benefit the majority, since its sole purpose to protect a minory from the majority via violent institutions (starvation and homelessness for those who don't comply, prison and death for those who revolt) 

“A nation of spaghetti eaters cannot restore Roman civilization!” ― Benito Mussolini (I could only 1.5x check this one unfortunately)

“Democracy is a kingless regime infested by many kings who are sometimes more exclusive, tyrannical and destructive than one, even if he be a tyrant.”

This interestingly is thought common totalitarian 

“There is a violence that liberates, and a violence that enslaves; there is a violence that is moral and a violence that is immoral”  
― Benito Mussolini

This could easily be a leftist quote. 

“It is better to live one day as a lion than 100 years as a sheep.”  
― Benito Mussolini

“We become strongest, I feel, when we have no friends upon whom to lean, or to look for moral gudance”  
― Benito Mussolini

These two quotes are just so patriachial. It is completely based of the isolated masculine man who doesn't need anyone but himself and is out to compete against all the other  men. Creating threats to sell protection. In other words, creating insecurity to sell security. 

“State ownership! It leads only to absurd and monstrous conclusions; state ownership means state monopoly, concentrated in the hands of one party and its adherents, and that state brings only ruin and bankruptcy to all.”  
― Benito Mussolini
