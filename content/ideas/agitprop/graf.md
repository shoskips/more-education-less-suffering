I love being out of the comfort zone, but don't question my political beliefs 

the system is not broken
it's working exactly as intended

we have more than enough food and shelter for everyone
it's just not profitable to provide them to everyine

internalise your religion, externalise your education

your hopelessness is propaganda

there's nothing more pathetic than being hopeless cause others are hopeless. 
my brother in christ, they're hopeless cause your hopeless. 
your hopelessness is propaganda.
i suggest you:
a) find a community that gives you hope.
b) educate yourself on past historical events that show humanity working together

woman goes to protest armed like a cop
they arrest her because they didnt hire her
even if they did
they wouldve fired her
for shouting statistics
which would devalue their boss' stocks

she attended their protest 
armed to the teeth
we assumed we had hired her
but strangely enough
she was cheering along
shouting statistics
which would devalue our stocks
we must stop her
no matter how many of our slaves lives it costs

if you hurt the market, the cops will hurt you

A hierarchy of deviance from the other hierarchy 

White augmentation 

From my experience, there is a distinct difference between gay and queer
Queer is a deviant from the kyriarchy in all of it's divisions
While gays deviate solely from heteronormative standards imposed by the patriarchy 
Since the kyriarchy has 7 other tentacles, it will sacrifice this one, in order to seem like it's doing us a favour.
We should be aware that freedom cannot be administered, just because something is free of charge (gratis), doesn't mean that it is free in general (liberty)
Therefore, like priveledged people believing the state cares for them
Or that the police keep them safe
Or an Arabic Jew taking refuge in Israel and pursuing a life that wouldn't be possible in their country of origin due to the lack of financial support from USA'S tax payers
The liberal gay feels taken under the wing of the free market, saving them from their otherwise doomed existence under a strong conservative government
The hetero man, who experiences backlash from the patriarchyt

They see this as the best deal on the table, cause capitalist realism/propaganda has swept the table clean of a world without capitalism, even an authoritarian one!

Cops are the biggest fools like literally you really are puppets

Political views are not opinions
They are degrees to which you have fallen for propaganda 
Beliefs that you have adopted 
Conclusions you have drawn 
Taking all into account 
Thinking you smart, well balanced
