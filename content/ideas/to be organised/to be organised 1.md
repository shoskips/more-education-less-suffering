Water isn't falling from the sky anymore, all that the sky is giving us is
bombs to drop on whoever it would be profitable to drop bombs on
If only we could print or speculate water like we do to make money out of thin air. I actually heard in an advertisement that inflation tastes really good in water, it binds well with all the microplastics

How about we learn about an alternative to capitalism 
üè¥üö©
and make water fall from the sky again

Sorry but save water isn't very profitable
What IS profitable is to destroy the environment enough for it to stop falling from the sky, and replacing it with bombs in the middle east

If only we could print or speculate water to make it out of thin air like we do with money

I actually heard on the BBC that inflation tastes really good in water, goes well with all the microplastics

don't bend, ascend

polishing the polish from his boots with our saliva
our tongues are numb, from the night before too
waiting for him to slip on our sweat
hoping that we win our bet
in the afterlife
over with this trife
the seeds of resistance are pushed deeper 
with every step
away from his loot
towards the grim reaper with our poisoned fruit
and if we embrace the rain
as much as we do the sun
the pain of bending
converts into the
joy of ascending
standing line bending over
dreaming of when this decent will be over
polluting the earth in his land rover

our tongues numbed from the bitter bootshine
the oppression will be our fertilizer

 Unless you haven't left your house or checked the calendar, you should have by now tangibly felt the effects of the climate crisis that we have gotten ourselves into. 

 Even a boomer who doesn't know how to tap tap click click a graph to their screen, has most definitely heard it brought up in a conversation but has quietly dismissed it as another fib that will, if anything, ensure their great-grandchildren a nice tan. 

However, as we all know nature gets great pleasure conserves itself,  is an exponential problem. The past eight months have consecutively broken record temperatures and there is no scientific reason for this will stop. 

Now if we are serious about finding a solution, we must identify the root cause. Unlike every other social issue, the fascists cannot pin the blame on immigrants, freedom fighters, the left or even pronouns. As for librals, well, the free market will have your slaves sorry I mean workers die of slavery oh i mean working before the market rewards you for your exploitation in the suncream sector.

Those of you who are multi-millionaire CEOs of oil and gas companies, now is your chance to swoop away in your private jet. 

 That being said, I could bet many policemen do not like doing this. Therefore, if they stop doing their job and no other policeman wants to do that job, then the job will never be done because the policemen certainly aren't. Gas and oil companies, however they are human beings living on our planet. Therefore the only person that would be willing to stop this would be anyone who's willing to change their beliefs and to get paid like a hitman. 
 

this is getting exponentially worse

graphs- temp, wages

the median average cost of a starting home for Gen Z is going to be like 500k-600k when 20 years ago (2000s) it was literally 1/3 of that ~$196,000. Have the homes gotten 2/3 better? From everything I‚Äôve seen the new homes being built are absolutely terrible quality, compared to older homes. So why are we paying more than ever to literally own a home that‚Äôs worse quality? Why are the people building homes paying more than ever for materials that are lower quality than before? Make that make sense. We continue to pay more and more for things that are lowering in quality each time we go back for more. The cost of labor hasn‚Äôt really gone up, but the cost of materials has, while their quality continues to lower. So where is all the money going if it isn‚Äôt to create better products?

Oh yeah, corporate shareholder‚Äôs pockets.

no one leaves home unless
home is the mouth of a shark
you only run for the border
when you see the whole city running as well

your neighbors running faster than you
breath bloody in their throats
the boy you went to school with
who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory
is holding a gun bigger than his body
you only leave home
when home won‚Äôt let you stay.

no one leaves home unless home chases you
fire under feet
hot blood in your belly
it‚Äôs not something you ever thought of doing
until the blade burns threats into
your neck
and even then you carried the anthem under
your breath
only tearing up your passport in an airport toilet
sobbing as each mouthful of paper
made it clear that you wouldn‚Äôt be going back.

you have to understand,
that no one puts their children in a boat
unless the water is safer than the land
no one burns their palms
under trains
beneath carriages
no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck
feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled
means something more than journey.

no one crawls under fences
no one wants to be beaten
pitied
no one chooses refugee camps
or strip searches where your
body is left aching
or prison,
because prison is safer
than a city of fire
no one could take it
no one could stomach it
no one skin would be tough enough

i want to go home,
but home is the mouth of a shark
home is the barrel of the gun
and no one would leave home
unless home chased you to the shore
unless home told you
to quicken your legs
leave your clothes behind
crawl through the desert
wade through the oceans
drown
save
be hungry
beg
forget pride
your survival is more important

no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear
saying ‚Äî
leave,
run away from me now
i dont know what i‚Äôve become
but i know that anywhere
is safer than here.

why don't you learn about the systems that could be put in place then? you think we can't organize ourselves without a corrupt system making us work? whatever the case may be, why wouldn't we educate and organize. It's exponential.  
  
i'm genuinely convinced the uk gov could pass any bs law that serves the rich or conservative social beliefs and the masses wouldn't do anything. any actually disruptful act of protest to change it would be scowled upon by those who do nothing but complain about it at the dinner table.  
  
we should talk to those closest to us about our past and how we have the power. nobody wants to be forced to work 40hrs a week in a world that is deteriorating itself and nobody has to.  
  
going to a village would be great and align with your immediate values, but plsssss don't just leave it as "it's horrific and although change is possible, i'm not convinced it could be happen". i'm not saying you need to do anything serious, but externalise your education. you know that the powerful just have a monopoly on ideas. don't respect others oppressive ideas. we can't have an absolutist mindset on being nice and peaceful.there is no justice and maybe it's peaceful in our respective lives, horrific things are happening about
