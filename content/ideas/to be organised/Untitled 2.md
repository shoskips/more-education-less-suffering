Their morality game has been the key to our chains

Passive power - mind viruses (the in/out, good/evil, normal/weird dichotomy) eg beliefs in superior races/cultures (search IDF tiktoks) ,not teaching critical thinking so that they don't challenge the status quo and fall for propaganda. Thinking that people are inherently  greedy, so we must sustain the system that rewards it. dolphinnature is bouncing beachballs on the noses for 4 hrs a day, I while spending the other 4 back flipping through hoops and eating 280p fish (search cultural hegemony)
circus dolphin objectification 

Active power - police (search 40% of policemen)
Portfolio power - military (search war investments) 
These are sustained via propaganda which will recreate itself , like an AI monster:

First they came for the jews
I remained silent cause I was not a jew

Then they came for queers
I didn't open my mouth cause I wasn't queer

Then they came for the Palestinians

Then they came for me
And the only ones brave enough to speak were gone

We remain silent when we havent actively educated 

Because passive education from mainstream media is propaganda. It's backed by the force who has fueled climate change and increased the level of narcissism. The one that will that will throw you and your family out on the streeT, I leaving your house empty to inc profits. Or maybe why you can 

It's the same reason why we stand in the egg pondering what level of chicken happiness we can afford the week

Undemocraticly funding a genocide, all the while increasing austerity.

And those who have fallen for the whole "war on Hamas" thing...

Firstly, the west is built upon manufacturing consent through public fear (creating islamaphobia, anti-semitism, red scare, satanic panic) it CREATES THREATS (can be real, via tickling with the imperialist tentacle, or fake) to justify starting wars (literal or ideological, I like the Cold War between Russia, and now China) for economic interests. Then it will SELL PROTECTION to those displaced by either the war or the fuck3d up economy. It itself is a safer, economically prosperous place (Europe) where they can migrate too, asking as they assimilate into western culture and slave themselves more intensely than the locals. The capitalist ofc will hire the cheapest worker, and the stupid state-loyal locals blame the immigrants 

 sell protection. Just like how it creates insecurity to sell security.

Back in the day, supporting colonialism-imperialism-capitalism had to be deprogrammed

Now, with the help of the internet, it's common knowledge what fucked up things are done for profit/domination

We just have to activate. Our lack of organization and education has led us here. Our circumstances won't change if we don't

So instead of just complaining, talk about the why's and the who's, connect the dots and spread awareness 

Do not be confused. There is only one battle. A war against wars. Against fascism.

duck cops, make soup

We grow up thinking poverty is just the way it is and all we can do is feel lucky and donate infront of others (including god) 

There's no way we would trust a group of people with such power






  

THEN YOU FIND OUT THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH FOOD AND SHELTER FOR EVERYONE BUT WE DO NOT DISTRUBITE IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT PROFITABLE ROBBINGBVGHHH

Don't worry plebs, your safe within our arms ðŸ”« we can print infinite cashðŸ’¸

He's talking about the infinite potential to rob us. The more money THEY print, the less valuable OUR LABOR becomes. It's called inflation. Overnight your money could be worth nothing if they decide to print into their own pockets. They do this, but slowly. It's called quantitative easing. But they could do it over night I'd they wanted. Whose gonna stop them? Their own police? 

Also, notice how the right always say you/your, while leftists say us/ our/we

Capitalism/colonialism/imperialism/legal-barbarianism will warp "cool" to whatever suits it

Because we are social animals, and fitting in is necessary for survival. 

We literally police each other with unwritten rules. If he was bragging about loading child porn onto a USB, the people would do something regardless of how busy protecting private property and hunting for white nostrils

How else could we have arrived here

I'm telling you that education and organization is cool

Our comrade has fallen victim. He let them instill fear win. 
And has bought the solution.
