democratic execution

we are at war against anti change,
against those who bow to undemocratic authority, crediting them for the "stablization" that they're convinced they have, and therefore must obey them if they want to avoid being on gods naughty list
considering that jesus was a palestinian communist, christianity has been morphed into passive income, because god takes some of the workload off of the state (police & military) therefore saving money, one side of the coin. moneu is debt, so is religion
saving is to the creditor
what earning is to the debtor

there are scary people out there
people who are sick
and they're sickening the rest of us
some spread mind viruses about how we sickened them
and they're the worst 

lucky for us will be sent to the scary afterlife

Police are active income, the others couldn't exist without them
God brings passive income for the state
Military is portfolio income 
income is power
power being the ability to impose your will on others
so power grows from violence
could be the barrel of a gun
 active income 
the other being passive, self perpetuating mind virus
violence on the mind 
the idea of being 
or to prison 
and violence on the body
the threat of being the prey of a predatory policeman 
or of being starved and freezer to death
and violence comes in many forms
or the threat of being sent to hella

the state is the owning class's friendly alter ego. 
I know your political knowledge is looking like a pretzel. and that OK, but it is selfish to be ignorant and not make an attempt to straighten them out for a clear understanding 
we're trained to call any belief outside of Norton's window crazy, and dismiss it as if there is nothing to learn from it. i

Since the Zionist project is an economic one, the solution will be an economic one. Ireland achieved independence (bueno...) not from attacking the British troops, but from attacking the British economy. It's precisely how we, the people, differ from the owning class.
Workers in banks are taught to hand over the money
