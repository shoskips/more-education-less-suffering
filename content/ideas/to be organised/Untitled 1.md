for ppl aged 16-40, thenumber one cause of death is suicide. so next time you look in the mirror, consider that the person that you are looking at is by far the most likely to kill you
Suicide is so boring. it's 100% more fun to live on the fringes of society. Be homeless. Do drugs. Verbally assault strangers in urban areas. That's where thew real magic is. live forever, make your existence force everyone around you to question reality.

Religion is the intersection of philosophy and politics. It exists in the spiritual plane and therefore immune to science. It is a good lubricant for unconditional love to the state, as well as a good target for corruption. Someone who thinks the world was magically created in a week is likely to buy a RedBull thinking that it will give them wings.
