graphs- temp, wages

the median average cost of a starting home for Gen Z is going to be like 500k-600k when 20 years ago (2000s) it was literally 1/3 of that ~$196,000. Have the homes gotten 2/3 better? From everything I’ve seen the new homes being built are absolutely terrible quality, compared to older homes. So why are we paying more than ever to literally own a home that’s worse quality? Why are the people building homes paying more than ever for materials that are lower quality than before? Make that make sense. We continue to pay more and more for things that are lowering in quality each time we go back for more. The cost of labor hasn’t really gone up, but the cost of materials has, while their quality continues to lower. So where is all the money going if it isn’t to create better products?

Oh yeah, corporate shareholder’s pockets.

no one leaves home unless
home is the mouth of a shark
you only run for the border
when you see the whole city running as well

your neighbors running faster than you
breath bloody in their throats
the boy you went to school with
who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory
is holding a gun bigger than his body
you only leave home
when home won’t let you stay.

no one leaves home unless home chases you
fire under feet
hot blood in your belly
it’s not something you ever thought of doing
until the blade burns threats into
your neck
and even then you carried the anthem under
your breath
only tearing up your passport in an airport toilet
sobbing as each mouthful of paper
made it clear that you wouldn’t be going back.

you have to understand,
that no one puts their children in a boat
unless the water is safer than the land
no one burns their palms
under trains
beneath carriages
no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck
feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled
means something more than journey.

no one crawls under fences
no one wants to be beaten
pitied
no one chooses refugee camps
or strip searches where your
body is left aching
or prison,
because prison is safer
than a city of fire
no one could take it
no one could stomach it
no one skin would be tough enough

i want to go home,
but home is the mouth of a shark
home is the barrel of the gun
and no one would leave home
unless home chased you to the shore
unless home told you
to quicken your legs
leave your clothes behind
crawl through the desert
wade through the oceans
drown
save
be hungry
beg
forget pride
your survival is more important

no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear
saying —
leave,
run away from me now
i dont know what i’ve become
but i know that anywhere
is safer than here.

meditacion in castellano: 

Note: light a candle and place it somewhere where it can be easily seen.

"Respira profundamente por la nariz y mantén la respiración mientras cuentas hasta 8. Ahora, por la boca, exhala
completa y lentamente. Continúe respirando larga y profundamente por la nariz y exhalando
por la boca. Tense todos sus músculos muy Fuerte, ahora, contando de diez a uno, suéltelos
lentamente, los encontrará muy Relajados. Ahora, mira la vela, mientras la miras, con cada respiración
y momento que pasa, te sientes cada vez más tranquilo y relajado. La llama de la vela
es pacífica y brillante.

Mientras la miras contaré de 100 hacia abajo, como una cuenta, tus ojos se volverán más y más relajados,
cansándose más y más con cada momento que pasa". Now, count down from 100, about every 10
numbers say "cuando llegue a xx tus ojos (o Encontrarás tus ojos) están cada vez más
cansados".

Tell them they may close Their eyes whenever they feel like it. If the persons eyes are still open
when you get to 50 then instead of saying
"tus ojos lo harán.."
Say "tus ojos son..."

When their eyes are shut say the following. "Mientras estás tumbado (o sentado) aquí con los ojos cómodamente cerrados
te encuentras relajándote más y más con cada momento y Respiración.
La relajación se siente placentera y dichosa así que, felizmente te entregas a esta maravillosa Sensación. Imagínate
en una nube, descansando plácidamente, con una ligera brisa acariciando tu cuerpo. Una sensación de hormigueo
comienza a abrirse camino, dentro y fuera de los dedos de tus pies, sube lentamente por ellos, haciéndolos cálidos,
pesados y relajados. La Nube es suave y sostiene tu cuerpo con su suave textura, la escena es apacible
y absorbente, la tranquilidad te absorbe por completo...
El hormigueo sube suave y lentamente por tus piernas, relajándolas. Haciéndolas cálidas y pesadas. El
relajación sienta muy bien, sienta tan bien relajarse y dejarse llevar. A medida que el hormigueo continúa su viaje
hacia tu plexo solar, sientes que tu estómago interno se relaja. 

Ahora, se mueve lentamente hacia
el pecho, haciendo que tu respiración también se relaje. La sensación empieza a subir por los brazos hasta los
hombros, haciendo que tus brazos también se vuelvan pesados y relajados. Eres consciente de la Relajación total que estás
y te dejas llevar por ella. El hormigueo se desplaza hacia la cara y la cabeza, relajando las mandíbulas.
El hormigueo se traslada ahora a la cara y a la cabeza, relajando las mandíbulas, el cuello y los músculos faciales, haciendo que tus preocupaciones se desvanezcan.
En el cielo azul mientras descansas felizmente en la nube...."

If they are not responsive or you think they are going to sleep, then add in a "...siempre
concentrándote en mi voz, ignorando todos los demás sonidos. Aunque existan otros sonidos, te ayudarán
en tu relajación..." 

They should soon let out a Sigh as if they were letting go, and their face should
have a "woodeness" to it, Becoming featurless... Now, say the following 

".... Ahora te encuentras en un
El pasillo es tranquilo y agradable. Mientras cuento de 10 a 1 te imaginarás caminando
más y más por el pasillo. Cuando llegue a uno te encontraras Donde quieres estar, en
otro estado superior de conciencia y mente. (cuenta de diez a uno)....."

 Do this about three or four
times. Then, to test if the subject is under Hypnosis or not, say....

"...sientes una sensación extraña en tu (brazo con el que escriben) brazo, la
sensación comienza en tus dedos y sube lentamente por tu brazo, a medida que avanza por Tu brazo tu brazo
se vuelve más y más ligero, pronto será tan ligero que ..... Cada vez más y más ligero que cada
respiración y momento..."


Their fingers should begin to twitch and then move up, the arm following, now my Friend, you have him/
hep in hypnosis. The first time you do this, while he/she is under Say good things, like: "your going to
feel great tomorrow" or "every day in every way You will find yourself becoming better and better".. Or
some crap like that... The more They go under, the deeper in hypnosis they will get each time you do it.







all by myself



Gabi is amazing. We had a crazy night out, where we recruited a couple of new members on the way to join us on our quest. At some point, we found a big cardboard tube, approximately 1 Gabi tall. She had the heart and soul to bring this potential digeridoo back home, though its been lying dormant in the corner of my room. I've actually thought about using this artifact as a rolling pin, but concluded that it's too dirty for culinary use. I could clean it but little pieces of cardboard would probably leak onto the dough

But yeah, she's very clean and respectful. Very funny and kind. And honestly, quite recommendable.
