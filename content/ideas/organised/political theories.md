we understand that violence will create excuses for them to further their violence agaisnt us
and that economic damage will be labelled wreckless, mischanelled anger
but if we dont all organize, and educate eachother on the truth
violence will be the only way

learn a marshal art so that only the police can violently blackmail you. 
keep your social media accounts on private so that only the corporations can privatize your info and sell it

so just to check i've understood correctly.
you don't care that a gnocide is being commited 

did you hear what the state did?
yeah, it was horrible


if only we extrapolated the graphs speculated how 

can we extrapolate these graphs and speculate the infinite deteriorization (ssuffering ) we are about to endure if we don't radical change doesn't take place

Every human being could be armed to the teeth and yet be perfectly safe because we don't have any reason to murder each other. 
In other words, I see gun violence as a symptom of social relations rather than the availability of firearms. 
Maybe it's naive, but eliminating the tension over life-sustaining resources seems to me to go a lot farther than simply keeping guns out of people's hands.

 the government is just the owning class' friendly alter ego

it's much easier to express yourself politically when you have an abundance of people to be friends with
small groups tie us together

Being ignorant is one thing

Thinking that learning nothing and doing nothing while showering in privilege is the moral path, is a whole different box of frogs

We wanna be hippies too but there are priorities. Fighting against fascism (Nazis) is necessary to liberate humanity. 

Spiritually will not free us from

Bio: My aim with these posts are to show how these social problems, that we are familiar with, are interconnected

I literally just want to stop racism and injustice in general 

If you can't take the time to atleast share something, or follow an account, that exposes the people we've given authority to, then your on the side of the oppressor. This isnt a Madrid thing. It's a global systemic thing. Saying [oppressed people] can be racist too is just mind numbing.  Have you ever seen an armed black guy sponsored by the state beating a white guy. Have you ever seen a trans police officer. There probably be one soon, since it's a gap in the market innit, especially when subsidized by the state for saving it's image and being used as an example for Librals to deny that transfobia exists 

There's no inbetween, either you on the side of the oppressed or the oppressor. 

We complain enough, we need to learn about solutions. 
We can motivate eachother to learn by informing, explaining, discussing. We need to clear up the confusion

White people wearing white shirts with motivational and spiritual mssages
Black people wraring blck shirts with political and agitative messages

The fundamental barrier is that we separate ourselves from them. The invisibke barriers

Our indoctrination is like water thst refracts the reality, at an angle bent towards keeping white european men in power, via a puedo science called the economy. 

To be a punk is to be revolutionary
But it's not easy to be a punk 

Britain and France have a culture of using "could" to stating that their request is in the hypothetical as if to avoid invading the reality of the request receiver. In Spain, they say "no" to loosen up the awkwardness of declination 

Europe creates insecurity in other continents via war and debt traps To sell securityImmigrants flee their bad living conditions. Since the threat of death is closer,Capitalists use their desperation to slave them more than a local would slave.A local has a less to lose, they have a family behind them and are better connected and more likely to unionizeThey are willing to work at a lower price Capitalists will While tricking the locals Systemic violence and physical violence are the same thing. You have to put your finger on the paper, the screen, I and trace it back to the rootSystemic violence is physical violence. Because it's hidden begin so many masks, we sometimes disconnect the twoIf you die of starvation or hungerDid nature kill you? Of course not! The ones who control the food and shelter killed youBecause you didn't play their gameThe one they claim to have created all of this food and shelter When in reality, without their existenceThe food would be fresherAnd the shelter would be cosier is the same thing.

The further the distance, wether it be racial, geographical, or any other type of natural occurring difference, the less the empathy.This post is designed to make us feel closer to eachother, to empathize The further the distance, wether it be racial, geographical, or any other type of natural occurring difference, the less the empathy.This is obvious, and completely natural. These posts are designed to make you feel closer to it. I'm sure you've said something about how stupid humanity is these days. If you really are the awakened person that you claim to be, you have to let others know that the world is at it's knees, in an attempt to bring it back to its feet like before these colonial brainworms crawled out of the tin. I'm just reminding you that kids are bein

 hard to make yourself useful without furthering the wealth gap

I'm sorry that your living in contradiction, it'll be all over once u become a white man who inherited alot of money or a leftist 

Small talk is objectifying
As we talk about our observations oh our surroundings. "How is Barcelona l?

Talking about our emotions as subjectify ourselves 

I just wanna be subjectified.

injecting you with insecurity to sell you security. mentally and physically.
understand that the mental manifests the physical.
so untwist it.
mentally, then physically.
or live in contradiction.
mentally and physically.

the only way to become bigger than yourself is to drop the ego.
that's where the collective begins.
when trapped in your ego
only a pseudo collective can form
and it will be destructive

double complain - complaining about thoses who are dling something about something else that you complain about

what yall praying for if it isn't the end of empires,settler states, and systems f domination, oppression and exploitation

never get too high with someone who grows
if you need help, no matter how much they love you
they will need to offload you

If we all live off passive income, and work becomes optional, then who will be doing the work to maintain humanity?
 There will be nobody left to privately rent. Passive income is made through owning someone else's labour; and it's only ethical when that "someone else" is a robot. e.g. 
 In other words, if everyone owns their house and a big chunk of the stock market, then the ruling class would cease to exist. Poor people who have no choice but to work (and no time to educate themselves on reality in which they live) are necessary to maintain capitalism. 

Also, to add to your wishlist of what "the ordinary person" should own, don't you think that we should collectively own and make the decisions for our respective workplaces? 
Or should it be disconnected shareholders who "took the risk" (of potentially having to declare bankruptcy and becoming a wage slave to the next, richer guy who's surfing an even bigger risk wave)?

Why not abolish private property? Since work is what creates value, not capital.
People could live comfortably from working 16 hrs a week if they didn't:
a) have to make money for their owners
b) have their money devalued with time, proportionately to how much less they have in the stock market (which doesn't "really exist") compared to the mega rich. 
To keep it short, graphs are extrapolated and trends are believed to continue forever. Of course infinite growth is impossible on the a planet with finite resources.
 These speculative bubbles are responsible for market crashes, which the working class always have to pay for. Furthermore, this vast wealth that is locked away in stocks cannot be turned into cash, due to a lack of liquidity as well as a lowering in price due to selling pressure (higher supply than demand), especially since people buy stocks with the sole purpose to sell them to someone else who thinks they can sell them to someone else who thinks others will want to buy it to sell them to someone else. If the stock is plummeting in value, then only those who think it's on sale will buy it. If it keeps plummeting, nobody will want it, and bam, that money that you thought you had has disappeared. This money is not real. 

 Also, you mentioned casually that we consume what we produce. Globally, we have more empty homes than homeless people (1 in 10 homes are vacant). We create enough food to feed 1.5x our population. One-third of all food produced is lost or wasted, which is approximately 1.3 billion tonnes of food. If wasted food were a country, it would be the third-largest producer of carbon dioxide in the world, after the USA and China.
 Unfortunately, it isn't profitable to distribute these resources to those who need them, if they can't pay ={
 In a capitalist society, products are made only to be sold, not to be used.

I'm glad you concluded with the political solution of taxing the rich, instead of encouraging us to work harder, or to skip dinner twice a week to buy a fraction of a tesla stock. 
However, playing into this game will only reinforce the oppression and exploitation committed ourselves and those below. 

You say that we should tax the rich more because they've got the wealth and they're not going to give it to us any other way.
The government are literally the rich that we should tax more, they're not going to give it up themselves. 
The system isn't broken, it's working exactly as intended. The government serves the rich, because the rich is the government. 

So what do we actually do? Vote labour after they've been shifting to the right for years to appeal to the voter-base? No, they'll think they're doing the right thing and serve the owning class just as much as the tories.

We need to protest, but not for a friendlier capitalism... learn about alternatives.

we just have to provide people with what they need so they can strike for longer, and eventually achieve want the want - the iphone 23 pluFREE TIME!

teach how to debate. have examples of common responses from differing political vieewpoints

being a capitalist without having significant privaledge, is to fall for meritocracy via the ludic fallacy, and the anti-communist propaganda via the nirvana fallacy, commiting the famous retrospective determinism in regards to the fall of thhe ussr
fueled by annecdotes purpetuating the psychologists fallacy

talks about your radical views. desensitize those around you
as those who will choose B
when presented with a scale of A to C

Every time a mercenary puts on an NYPD uniform, selling their capacity to inflict violence for the highest bidder, they are committing treason against humanity.

Alot of us think it's contradictory to take a taxi to an anticapitalist protest.
It's our responsibility to learn to teach

The least privileged to have the least to loose and the most to gain
Post revolution, they will be relatively advantaged, knowing useful skills and having greater resilience to *austerity?*

Like how slavery hurts everyone's soul masters 
The patriarchy hurts everyone's soul 

And the men who claim to hate feminism the most
Are the feminist's greatest Ali 
They 

Men are unaware that a lot of their suffering stems from the patriarchy
And so they blame their feminist allies instead
As Malcom x said, if your not careful, the oppressor will convince you that the oppressed, especially those fighting against oppression, are the oppressors. Proportional to their attempt to fight against it

Don't go to fight against China. Thank you in advance 

Where hierarchy exists,
It will attract the corrupted,
Corrupt the good intentioned,
And ultimately mangle the society which it dominates

Feed me food 

If I feed enough people for free
I will go to jail 
And I won't be able to make music there

Dear hippies
Change comes from within
Yes
Now become political 
But don't become a politician 

every fascist is a confused and passionless person that projects

hajsjs usually are aware of both their alienation and their insecurities, so they're significantly less likely to be capitalised upon, in both the short term and the long term sense 

Capitalist uses our undivided will to feel important, by tampering with our ideas of importance and success
