In a hand shake:

A wide sweep of the arm
Leaving the wing vulnerable 
As opposed to a square 
Refracted genuine

Every time I listen to "I might"
Agree more with the following statement: the glitches are perfect
But maybe that's just because I'm engraining what perfect is

We failed to perpetuate our structure into the future 
Limboing the threshold of the great filter of entropy 

somewhere out there 

if your still out there

a haunted house

floating there, a drop of water in a vast ocean, drop drop drop, part of the whole, fading into the background, fading, fading, fading, gently travelling down on a current, being guided by this gentle force, down, down, down. no worry exists here, all droplets are the same relaxed, relax, relax, relax, part of the whole, nothing else exists, nothing, nothing, nothing. nothing to be, nothing to do, all carried by the rest, carried, carried, carried. rising and falling with the swell, falling, falling, falling, a vast ocean below an empty sky, empty, empty, empty.

When they isolated us in our homes and towns, we found and built communities online. When they kicked us out of class and put us in detention, we carved love
letters and memoirs into the wooden desktops. When they cut the power to our basement punk shows, we screamed without electric amplification: “Rather be alive!”
When they shut down the abandoned warehouses that we had brought back to life, we partied in the desert and in underground storm tunnels using generators.
When they evicted and abandoned us, we built networks of mutual aid and community self-defense. When they dismantled our pirate radio station, we installed a
bigger antenna and sailed farther out to sea. When they banned us from social media sites, we reconvened on decentralized and encrypted platforms.
