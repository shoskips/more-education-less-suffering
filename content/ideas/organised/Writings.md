***In the UK atleast***
I noticed that the topic of economic oppression was common
In cafes, on the street, at bars, at work
Participants included all subdivisions of workers
I thought, "is it just me? Are they catering to my interest"
But not only this was long before I became politically active, 
I overheard it, everywhere
Even on the news, by those who were allowed to speak on behalf of the people

We share the struggle 

The red pull is communism




Like how the N word has been embraced, and liberated from the racist associasions
We need to free the word communist, for, and by thoso who advocate for a communist society
