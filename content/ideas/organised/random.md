truffle hunter
i fart and i forget, i pee and i remember, i poop and i understand
wizard bean
chasing a wild goose called michael ryan
feed your lover carrots so they can see you in the dark
Homework strike 
Shagging the mango

Last night I could touch my toes 
nothing more subjectifying than a good psycadelic drug 
If one swallows a carbohydrate 
That one couldn't crush with their tongue
Then one is gonna fart real bad

In the metro
a guy standing on one platform
Said to his friend 
Who is standing on the other side of the platform 
"Ya you sure ya don't want any juice? I've got some juice"


One can't listen to it an infinite number of times
Though one can infinitely listen to it

Sometimes I close my eyes
And my imagination starts to stack cheese
While audio of some kind lingers In the background 

La revolución no será televisada 
El genocidio, si

Bloodshare

Critical friendship
