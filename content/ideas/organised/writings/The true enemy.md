Everyday we wake up
And everyday we fight against it
Everyday we lose
Though we still resist
Analysing our mistakes
We couldn't help ourselves
Because it's our instict
The most basic instict of all
To purpetuate ourselves into the future
Despite entropy 
So the question is
Who is us?
Is it the neurological circuit that seeks to loathe in my room all day?
Perhaps my entire self, competing against others to thrive in this world, since second place is steak knives
Or 

The anger that I cultivate by the thought of zooming into the stock market, to only  loose my time and my money. I was spurred on, by others and my own ego who thought i was "being smart", by investing my money instead of partying and making friends. Yeah, whatever, say I wanted to do it anyway. But *why* did I want to isolate myself? My ego told me "thing that (insert my name) should do, since you're mature now and your not an idiot like the rest of the world.

watching videos on the web instead of the app

do you actually *want* to have a smoother User experience?
Is it not just about watching videos?
Won't it encourage you to stick to longer videos or even not watch youtube at all if it's sluggish to use?
Isn't this what causes addiction?
