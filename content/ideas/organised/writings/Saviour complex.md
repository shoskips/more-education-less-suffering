We exist in a cocktail of a barbaric system that has peppersprayed us with propaganda to the point that we've just gotten used to it, and aren't even aware of when we're getting peppersprayed anymore. C

With a common knowledge of barbarism a) in the past, and b) in the global south. Many europeans also look at america and china for their degeneracy, while forgetting that we are in a ship thats wheel it's firmly gripped by the capitalists, to which they are the gold standard.

They want to save the babies and the woman, while condemning the beautiful bearded men who are actually doing something against the colonialists.

This is part due to the individualist ideas spoon-fed to us from a young age. We're trained view situations through the lens of "what's in it for me". 

This reminds me of the term "radical centrism", where someone expresses themselves in a way that will not upset anyone. Despite initially having views, a radical centrist will have no concrete views, basing them solely off of the acceptable average of society
