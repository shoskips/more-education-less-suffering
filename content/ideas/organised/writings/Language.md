A couple of months ago, one of my favourite artists, [otto benson,](https://wnoadiarwb.us/dates/)changed the titles of a couple songs (that he'd named after the dates he made them) from the North American date notation MMDDYY to the unhyphenated YYYYMMDD in accordance withÂ [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). I saw it as were a What I abstracted from this symbolic action was that misunderstandings can come about whenever we decide to

Both fascists and communists, don't refer to themselves as such when communicating to others

From my experience, the majority of communists want to dissasociate from the word

I completely understand why fascists don't identify as fascists (atleast outside of their circles). They even hide the views with people they don't know, in cities. Though in villages, they tend to be more confident. It's all about the views of the average person in a setting 

Communists however, have nothing to hide. They want a better world, they help their communities. They're misunderstood. My friend once told me "I'm a communist, but the thing is you can't say it nowadays, the new term is social justice". I have heard people use social justice synonymously with social democraticy, which is essentially friendly capitalism. A system which, will still throw a granny on the street when her pension runs out. 
However, Africans have embraced the n word, despite all of it's negative connotations.

A revolution entails two parts:
- the negation of the current/old^^
- the construction of the new 

I say current/old, because we are in a tug of war between freedom/communism and domination/fascism (patriarchy, white supremacy, poverty, heteronormativity)

Liberals, who see these social problems in vacuum, beg people to stop being sexist and racist, rather than identifying the hierarchies that create these problems.
Anarchists, who see these social problems intertwined in a network of domination, aim to dismantle the oppressive systems that facilitate these acts of bigotry. For example, a liberal will say that we need to stop being sexist, while an anarchist would say that we need to end the patriarchy. Instead of saying that we need 

Marx said that history is based on class struggle. Although this perspective doesn't disregard other struggles, it prioritizes the class struggle over the other struggles

Do you want the state to be completed disconnected from the church/religion?
If the answer is yes then you are a Satanist

What's the connotation behind Satanist though? Is it one that you'd like to have attached to you by people who couldn't pour piss out of a Wellington boot with the instructions written on the bottom?

We are much more comfortable talking shit about religion than about capitalism. This is more offensive and blames religion for 

A weapon that aspires to be useless 

This is one of my personal criticisms of Marx/classical Marxism. 

If you






Most people are discontent with the current. Whether it's due to
- being stuck in a hamster wheel of work to the point that it consumes them - they have nothing else going on in their lives and feel like strictly a cog in the machine
- feeling alienated 


Some think that this is the best we can organise society 
Some think that we can do better, but the powerful stop us 
Some people want a

While taking into consideration that
- it might be dangerous to explicitly state radical positions in specific circumstances
- we shouldn't let words define us (especially anarchists, who share a philosophy rather than a blueprint)

I personally think that we should agree, or make an attempt to agree on specific definitions

We already have definitions that harmonise on multiple dictionaries, however as the propaganda campaigns leak deeper into the creaks and crevasses of the society, they have been conflated with other concepts and adopted a myriad of false connotations. 

If you ask everyone what their opinion of communism is, 80% will be negative, 10% will be neutral, and 10% will be possible 

However, when you ask what their understanding of communism is, or what the definition of it is, you will find that very little people know it. And it's a pretty simple concept. 

**A communist society is a moneyless classless stateless society.** 

This is the basic definition. Of coure this entails much more, afterall, it is quite a displacement from our current set up. from this, we can extrapolate that it will entail the abolition of police, borders, private property.

One very important distinction is to be made:
**This definition does not include how we arrive there***



How we arrive there, aka the *means* is a massive point of debate among communists, and the means that usually consume the definition is the proposal that marx presented in the communist manifesto - the only book he wrote that consulted the *construction of the new* rather than the *negation of the current*
The same conclusion will be reached if you substitute *communism* for *socialism, capitalism, anarchism* and *libertarianism* 



This isn't just the fault of the propaganda from the right (the state).

The main connotation stuck to communism is, you guessed it, a big totalitarian goverment, ruled by the *communist* party that will capture whoever dares to skip the cabbage line and toss them into the gulag, which is of course much worse than a typically western prison 
Similarly,
I've noticed a lot of people blaming religion for all of this fuckery. Religion itself is harmless, it only becomes harmful whenever it becomes politicised. Since religion is such a commitment that bases itself in faith, blind belief that transcends rationality, it's roots penetrate deep into ones identity. 
Since *identities serve as a reference point to our consciousness that track our ego and in relation to time,* otherwise we would go schizophrenic. Psychedelics oppose this, and therefore can cause schizophrenia if too high of a dose is taken by someone who's primed for the other dimension 
Since identities keep us from remembering the absurdity of our existence, stopping us from melting into one with our surroundings (familiar eh?) going crazy, we have a bias to act in consistency with it.

The *straightedge* movement was literally to give an identity to those who didn't fully fit into the typical punk identity. Instead of being a non denominational person with punky tendencies, we had to create a family for these dissendents to reside in
