There are groups who pounce on delicate situations to profit, and there are "indivduals" who are riddled with the malware known as the savour complex.

Look, Zionists disgust me on all axis. I have different tolerances. For example, a guy with Moroccan roots who moves to Israel to ~~be indoctrinated~~ have access opportunities which he otherwise would've remained locked in a colonized country

That guy from new York though. The one who went over to settle in occupied Palestine. The Palestinian family said "you're stealing our home".
He said "if I don't steal it, someone else will", with a "sorry to break it to you, this is unfortunately the world we live inm I hope everything works out you guys'
