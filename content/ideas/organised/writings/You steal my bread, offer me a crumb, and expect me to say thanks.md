It's insulting. I have a friend who's a neo-taxi-driver, working 12hrs a day without any rights as a worker. 

In return he receives the ego boost of feeling self employed and it is offered...wait for it... A free introductory session of physio therapy 

The state is simply the corporations' little bitch. It's job is to stop the people from revolting
