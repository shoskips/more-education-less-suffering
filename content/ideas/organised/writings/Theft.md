If every ping-pong table had rackets,
Why would anyone steal them?
To sit on our shelves
To remind us who we are


Toes spasmingly high

Smoked up
Skated home
Shoe
Lay in bed
My ears are full
of stars on the lids
Noticed my toes were twichin out
So I focus all of my attention
On not letting my wee toesies spasm
And all of a sudden, I was in nirvana 
I was 


Is there such thing as expropriation?
