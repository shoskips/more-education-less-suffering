We fist bump
After bumping into one another 
In the highway of the house 
The foyer of the flat
You signed my cap
The shadow of the cat flap
Loop to a



After you were vomiting your guts out
While I was sprawled
All ova tha sofa
Not making da mosta (it)

Brazillian butterfly 

Compulsive liar honest in the face of the state
Me, the opposite now I'm playin a new game 
Criss crossed with an x through my name
Can't you just help
Construction is the best destruction 
Compose on top of organic decomposition 
Sediment in the air of last systems sentiment
Somethin the top left often forget 
Feel like I can't leave it open ended
Without the wires being bent in whatever direction suits best (worst) Arts not place for those
Who are blinded by the clothes 
And see it through their own lense and jump to conclusions, encrypt it like nazi bullshit

Hard leftist revolutionary don't shave your pits
But you must admit when the bush hairy
Shit is sweaty ain't merry
Takes a wizard or two to uninstall
Factory reset Joseph and Mary 

I don't usually speak like this, but neither do they

The hole point of allowing someone to be mainstream is that they don't politically cross the political line


Nazi malware

Brother hand my the child
You need both hands to steady your aim
DJ Sabrina ain't no litmus test

A colonizer's baby⁷ is not indigenous. 
May the sun burn the disingenuous
Until they remember what was forgot
Voluntarily displaced out of ignorance
Inventing terror creating immigrants
Institutionalised fingerprints 

Barely render the complexity of a fellow entity
Due to figments of a superior pigment


We have no fucking idea of what communism is 

Mentally slender like an enderman 
Melt in the rain or drown 
Game over on the screen 
No more 
Figments about a superior pigment
Hate and fear 
Good performer now snores when he slumbers 
Loosing points raising the sheeps numbers
Eyes covered with cucumbers
Painting X's on doors 
Fainting through the floor boards 
Always a bummer 



Cops are amazing you know cause like 
The moon be made of cheese
Storm d10 with weez

Don't buy the one with the dented tin
Why, because the tin is dented

Pay attention 
I see you floating away 
Driftin through the other dimension 
Not to mention 
Dopamine retention 
Seen sprinkling hash on playlist 
Called my next Ascension 

Daydreams of being a campañon
Traveled down a tandoori tandom
To how I can write a zine
To get them kids fired up
Like a firework at night time
Before Halloween wouldn't be merry
But these things scary
...
How you just gonna air me 
tall temperature meant
somethin different for all
one thing to know about the afterglow
no temp employment by the tooth fairy
when the teeth fall out and the tongue hairy
grow weary where we go with contempt
Her ego collapse on top of your tent 
Brother be sent to phone an ambulance to cover your tone
Gotta stop smokin that home grown, chokin on that perspective you call your own
mopin up the stout with ket all up in your snout
Forget the night better yet all you known thats etched
isn't a virtue to be grown yet stretched
perplexed in a maze of tatoos
like a moose in the headlights
can't move, phone a fiend who bite the bed bug
Thinkin like a knight, shrug when she blunder
Wants to forfeit, how she gonna mother another othered
Great hugger
Struck no luck, but by thunder
Must be drunk night funk 
Spends all night in a metaphorical flight
covered in a loose rag rug, societal wreckage
Drag the crate under the noose
smug smile with the anti state message on the mug fetched from the 14 aisle
charlie sheen screamed helium lets follow mycelium
void voyager sets sail aboard the canabinoid derail
Trains and boats have morphed 
man stabbin freud still a kinder
mad not to strike a match with his mom on tinder
this dream lingers
what does it mean, what does it prove?
 hinder his abilty to
swallow the seeds sewn to the groove
Like a bad ketamine batch unfollows 
"help soothe" on the cool bottle
cause to breathe is luxury in full throttle
borrow time from the gold mine 
flash fuck struck us lucky
mold of a hollow tomorow of adultery
taboo like rubbery cutlery in the shrubbery of a nunnery
recovery of buttery hands is such a drudgery
hide right infront of me 
Getting all stuttery and muttery
When I get confrontary 
Newly flowering pots sit at the front
oven crops reside at the back
Raised truely in the shadows 
Never grazing new grass
Even when tether weathers



Writ to face the brunt of the smack
out scouring the ground dissectin the maps, dismiss it as a new bird outta place in the meadow, floor of the metro
that towering sound makin your lemon curd 
was a red bright and blue drone
heard a third white mother moan gremlin true
im foaming at the mouth
whos steering the nautica, is it klaus is it you?
yankin the strings hanging out of my peers
direction abaqa
choppin us up like estaca in the trap     set out for the mouse
Sounds generous when you forget about all them cows you submitted   
Treason committed like no pasa nada
Sqeakin around their minds 
Tryna find a reason to justify their prada 
Necklace, thinking it'll leave their crush breathless
It's a cesspool of

bombin and bombin, raining a crisis 
Complain about isis, head full of propagandistic lices
Can't refrain from slippin a sciency nazi in for every rip 
in a clandestine operation called paperclip 
The powerful will never be an enemy
Instead a rival to give lip and masterbate over secretly 
Assimilate or assassinate, 2 door labyrinth, beginnig and end

Trains take freight through four borders frequently 
Carriages for other orders
Brother brewing more absinthe in the corridors 
Agent Orange 
Musk's musket market stewing 
Target those whose bros bark it
Was the fate, they are the cheese they grate
Feta is the meta, nutralized 
Free the products they create 
Won't ever realise it when it's too late (today)
Brainwashing electorial
Shed a tear 
 
Mk Ultra whiz the multa 
in your drink with a stick 
Their kink brings you to the brink
Of the ice rink
Stinking of double think 
Can't link the winks to bring a blink
Fall on the ice, break your brain, mail some bombs

common knowledge, rare understandage
Monopolized college sandwich
Wasn't the nicest, bare and theft me like the finest
Farts float smelly or gentle
Oriental diet bloated belly microbiome riot
Arts cry it, mountain goats
Flip the terrain quicker than genocide and slavery
Eastern bloc was just a line and a cabbage 
Not a campist, but who's the bigger savage?




Different food same shit

Familitary

Fascist father's favourite artist is anarcho communist

bite the bullet, comb the mullet

law of averages created art that spread
eyes on hands off no red
rick, what the fuck? you make me sick
ill snap your dick instead 
Goodluck there's angle for every one you bled and strangle
hell is eternal so i wish you rabies
thermo used by your comrades before inferno

Hate slaughtering while rejecting the only means by which anyone has ever gotten free, is just a question guilt laundering

Fucked the second your fight a way to itch

political conciounce of a teddy bear
those moans real or fake

Disappointed that you aren't dancing to the song I'm playing through my headphones 

s

fringe small and present 
annoying like mosquitos in the feather of a pheasant
's tail
Feel the site where the parasite writes the bites in Braille  
the grand narrative's nothing more than a fat ficticious tale
Tethered to the fascistic superintendent
Peasant frail and sleep the night tight like curly kale
Keep straight no turns no bends
Unsure that the gods will justify the ends
Set sail the Cannabinoid derail
Toying with the omnipresent hammer and crescent
Farmer wants a meal but TV eyes swirly and computer square 
To squeal is girly and unfurls the appeal 
Though a single straw severed from the law claws back in row 
cause you know, a bail measures more than the sum of its parts in a stack
When the finger slip the nail split at the white part at the back
Trail unpleasant, blindy fell into jail 
Wakeboarding behind the shell of a snail, smack
Pale sky it linger at noon 
Goon not paying attention, floated to the other dimension via the tune
Beats flippin the trip like flume
The room full of photos of spoons
A woman never bloom
Attached to the broom
Sweeping it under the carpet 
To satisfy the groom
Double knuckle grip on the pyramid no room 
Fell in, saw my name engraved in a tomb
Though in the VIP section, along with all the biggest baboons 
Buckle whip, glare of the ***heir***loom 

Write a rhyme that goes back in time getting the forum goin
Just don't tellem which samples I'm throwinvarv

Squeal to loose the appeal 
Any guy can be a baby girl, but it takes a man to be a wife
He has to thrown them out the ripped the jeans 
Can't be neutral on a moving train
Tell me 
What 
Whatever you want
Though rolling paper unconditional 
Forgot the colour of his blood

dropped the plot like an astronaught

Kee-ai

Your capitalist dad told you that socialism is bad
Faster, my friend, the old world is behind you 

Armed with cobblestones and parasols

Workshop to safely abort babies 

Case hey mixed up
Tryna get arrested at a liberal feminist protest
If I cross the line then I'll invite my friends to do time
Fillin the prison with friends of mine

Hiding behind a metaphor 
With the old tail erect like a sail,
placed to face the furly gale
Waves effervescent, 
At noon the moon crescent like the root of a nail 
Mailed tied up like a bale
Withhold the curly kale, organic with the snail
In touch like Braille, pass it along the trail before it gets stale 
though the nail grew frail, as a pale male sippin on ale 
Came to rein, Flippin the game
Shippin them off 
Tied up like a bale 
We are the god who rains bail
Education is an invitation which precedes 
Activation which succeeds 
The altercations brought forth by unrelenting agitation
Lower intensity longer duration 
In the propensity station
In the quotation, prouder than a nation 

Treat food like the holy grail 
pigeon's bringin you the mail
Though the hinge fall now the weather's calmer
No libido anti depressant family looking you an embalmer 
Receiving other mail of a brother probably stale

Diamond in the rough sought out but really omnipresent 
No remorse left for theft that brought the golf course
Fin of a dolph lies in the rough
Altruistic acoustic style pleasent
Dick bigger than a horse and prehensile 
Almost communicates in silence
Just click whistle guerrilla stuff 
Give it enough time defended by force to lose its kindness 
Bending the boards, warping the origins of the essence 
Foraging for the fulfilling chords the 4th ascending
Amending the porridge to the kin of the 

Maintained by force 
drapes down like an objectified clown subject 
to sell dos amigos there makes a lack of acid aminos
Inject a boss in the cave they frack
mazes paved in puzzles
It's not a lifestyle mom it's just a phase
Just looking for some grass to graze 
Rasied loveless, to paraphrase, I embody the newest craze 
Blaze 
Erase
Butterfly effectively sipped half the absinthe puddle 
the master and the slave align their paths
Behave while shipped with the muzzle 
A labyrinth to the grave don't get it muddled 
takes a brave swine to spend their bath
amending a box to numbers one through nine

Wedges me in the crux of everything 

You know what else is hard?
hen you could bending your thoughts to rhyme 
In a scheme that flakes apart the fascist's dream
Of a dichotomy, splintered by Michael Jackson ideology 
In the limbo of cor

Still in the same mode as before
Just don't think about it no more
Gonna be sore of playing 
Need for weed
Will be freed once we all are
Shining like a black star
Hell I wouldn't blame the cane
For crushing you all the same
As the empirical candy floss
In the ass of your boss
Member of the glass class
Where you find the moss patch
Chillin like the frosties man

Publicly funded 
But only profits are privitized 
Cough it be there 
Cause the revolution won't be televised 
Make me aware 
Of this carnival circus fare
Of all this bullshit occupying the air 
How this won't change despite who's mayor
Fairer hare than turtle teddybear
Fértil 
That activates my third eye
Not that activates my third leg
Beam of energy keeps me criss cross like mog and meg
Stock raised like stalks 
After we pull up our socks 
And cremate the system with foc
Ashes blown in flashes 
Dragging entropy through the  molasses 
Back to the graph we extrapolated 
To which everything was overrated 
Stated the very facts it needed to hide
Somewhere in a bucket full of pride
When I slide past an empty pair of hands
Beside a request to fill them with cans
Blame the black and tans
Uniform that is, I'm not racist 
Sometimes the value lies behind the face
But when theres no bitcoin miner
shit can't be deciphered
cant walk on wings

Dark meat forearms grinding herb all night

Can't ignore the facsim that exists
Cause your not oppressed 

shoot the last shot f absynth 
quasi treatment turning this maze withhin a labrynth

said the photo was to be 9 mega or less
mines 9.2 i said 
fuck the passport and masturbated instead

Expandin my perspective beyond my own, smokin that home grown

You tell me to me not to spit on the floor
