**RYE SOURDOUGH *loaf***

Ingredients:
❑ 100 grams of rye flour
❑ 900 grams of bread flour
❑ 750 grams of water
❑ 150 grams of sourdough starter
❑ Pinch of salt
❑ 1 tablespoon of caraway seeds

Instruction:
1. In a large bowl combine the rye flour, bread flour, and water. Mix until the 
water has been absorbed by the flour.
2. Then add in the 150 grams of sourdough starter and pull, shake, and fold.
3. Give it a rest for 30 minutes and then add in your salt and caraway 
seeds. Give it another pull and fold and rest for 30 minutes.
4. Continue giving your dough 2 more pull and folds giving the dough 30 
minute intervals after each fold.
5. After the last pull and fold let the dough sit for 30 minutes to relax the gluten.
6. Shape the dough into two dough and let them proof in a banneton until it has 
doubled in size. This could take anywhere to 4 hours or overnight.
7. Once the rye dough has doubled in size, preheat your oven to 475 degrees 
fahrenheit along with a cast iron pot and lid.
8. While everything is preheating go ahead and score your bread.
9. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown!


**SOURDOUGH *baguettes***

Ingredients:
❑ 500 grams of white flour
❑ 500 grams whole wheat flour
❑ 650 grams of water
❑ 150 grams of Sourdough Starter 
❑ 10 grams of salt
❑ Ice Cubes for baking 

Steps:
1. In a bowl, mix together with white flour, whole wheat flour, and enough
water to get about 65% hydration. Let that sit (autolyse process) for at least
45 minutes. 
2. After the autolyse process, pour in the sourdough starter and add in some salt.
Mix that all together until it’s nice and incorporated. 
3. Start stretch and fold for every 45 minutes for 2 hours to develop the gluten
structure. 
4. You can perform a stretch test, you can see how at here.
5. After stretch and fold, let the dough rise in the fridge overnight until it
gains about 40-50% mass. 
6. Flour the kneading surface. Put the dough on the surface & start dividing into 4
pieces. 
7. Start pre-shaping the divided dough and let it sit for about 30 minutes before
the final shaping.
8. Give the baguettes a final shaping. You can see how that is done here.
9. Proofing hack for baguettes at 10:36
10. Let it proof for about 2 hours until they pass the poke test. 
11. Preheat the oven at 500°F, and bake the baguettes. Baking hack, adding some
ice cube on a tray and put it in the bottom because the ice will slowly melt 
and release steam which will help with the oven spring and the color on the
baguettes. 
12. After 20 minutes, turn the oven down to 450°F and cook for another 20-25
minutes until they are golden brown


**PITA**

Ingredients:
❑ 2 teaspoons of dry active yeast
❑ 1 cup of warm water
❑ Drizzle of maple syrup
❑ 3 cups of flour
❑ Drizzle of olive oil
❑ Sprinkle of salt

Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, combine the active dry yeast, warm water, and a drizzle of maple 
syrup. Let this proof for about 15 - 20 minutes or until nice and puffy.
2. Then add in your flour, olive oil, and salt. Combine until it start to come to a dough.
3. Take it out of the dough and start kneading it until it comes into a soft and supple
dough.
4. Give it a rest to relax the gluten a bit. (about 30 minutes)
5. Then once it has rested, knead it for 5 more minutes.
6. Let this proof for about 1 hour.
7. Once fully proofed, deflate it and cut into small balls. You should get around 12 balls.
8. Roll out each ball to a round flat disk.
9. Meanwhile, oil up a cast iron and place in the oven at the highest temperature that 
your oven goes to.
10. Place one of your pita dough onto your pan and bake for 3 minutes.
11. They will puff up (not all pitas puff up perfectly) and you are ready to fill you pita


**CHALLAH (BUBBLE BREAD) *loaf***

Ingredients: 
1 package of yeast 
¼ cup sugar 
1 cup of water 
2 Eggs 
4 cups of all purpose flour 
2 teaspoons of salt 
4 tablespoons of butter 

Instructions: 
1. In a small bowl, combine the yeast with 2 tablespoons of water and let this bloom 
for about 10 - 15 minutes or until the yeast starts floating to the top. If your yeast 
doesn’t activate then throw it away and use some fresh yeast. 
2. Once your yeast has been activated your can move onto the next step which is 
adding all the wet ingredients to a standing mixer. Combine the activated yeast, 
sugar, the rest of the water, and the eggs until every kind of comes together. 
3. Then in another bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually mix the flour mixture into 
wet ingredients. Once the dough comes together let dough rest for 20 minutes. 
4. Once your wet ingredients has absorbed your flour, slowly throw in your butter pieces by 
piece until all the butter is incorporated into the dough. 
5. Knead the dough in the mixer for about 10 minutes more or until you get a smooth, 
elastic, and supple dough. 
6. Take the dough out and knead for another 2 - 3 minutes just to shape it a bit more and 
to form it into a ball. Then set it in a grease proofed bowl. Let it rise for about 1 ½ hours 
or until it doubles in size. The timing on this varies from room to room. Say your kitchen 
is very cold, it will take longer so it would be best to leave it in the oven with the light 
on. With four of the pieces, roll them into tight balls, stamp them with the kaiser roll
stamper. 
7. Once the dough has proofed, knock out the air and pat it into a rectangle. From the 
side furthest away from you pinch it and roll in towards you to create a log shape. 
Roll outwards from the center. 
8. Cut out 6 pieces lengthwise (about 177 grams each) and braid into a 6 braided 
challah. You can check out my video to see how I did that here. 
9. Place the braided challah onto a parchment lined baking tray and let the dough rise 
for another 1 - 1 ½ hours or until the dough has doubled in size. 
10. Preheat your oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit and egg wash your challah bread. 
11. Lastly sprinkle on some poppy seeds and bake for 35 minutes!

1 ½ cup of warm water (105 degrees fahrenheit) 
⅛ cup of olive oil 
4 cups of flour 

Instructions: 
1. Add all the ingredients to a large bowl and mix together until you get a cohesive dough ball. 
2. Hand knead 5 - 10 or until smooth and elastic. 
3. Drizzle in some olive oil in a bowl and let the pizza dough ferment overnight. 
4. Your dough should be doubled in size (if not, let it rise a little longer at room 
temp) 
5. Your dough is now ready


**SOUR RYE** *loaf*

Ingredients: 
• ¼ cup of wheat berries 
• 2 tablespoons of sunflower seeds 
• 2 tablespoons of flax seeds 
• 2 tablespoons of pumpkin seeds 
• 500 grams of water 
• 350 grams rye flour 
• 350 grams whole wheat 
• 130 grams of starter 
• 1 tablespoon of molasses 
• 15 grams of fine salt 

Instructions:
1. The night before place ¼ cup of wheat berries, 2 tbsp of sunflower seeds, 2 tbsp 
of flax seeds, and 2 tbsp of pumpkin seeds in a mason jar and add enough water 
to cover. Let them hydrate overnight. 
2. In a large bowl add 350 grams rye flour, 350 grams whole wheat, and 500 grams 
of water and mix with a danish whisk to combine. Let it autolyse for about 30 
minutes. In the meantime drain your hydrated seeds and set aside. 
3. Once your bread has rested add in 130 grams of starter, 1 tablespoon of 
molasses, 15 grams of fine salt, and the hydrated seeds. Fold everything into your 
dough until it is incorporated and let it rest for 1 hour. 
4. After the hour is up give it a stretch and fold. It will be a bit hard to do since there 
isn’t much gluten in the dough. Do the best you can and then give it a rest for 30 
minutes. Repeat this step three more times for a total of four stretch and folds. 
5. After all the stretch and folds are done, place the dough into the fridge overnight 
for its bulk ferment. 
6. In the morning, shape it into a tight log and place it into your greased pullman loaf 
pan. Let it rise for about 3 hours on your counter. Once you notice that it has 
risen, give it a couple of scores and close up your pullman loaf pan. 
7. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and bake for 20 minutes. Once the 
20 minutes are up, take off the pullman loaf lid and bake for an additional 20 
minutes. Let your rye wheat bread cool off until you are able to handle it.
