why don't you learn about the systems that could be put in place then? you think we can't organize ourselves without a corrupt system making us work? whatever the case may be, why wouldn't we educate and organize. It's exponential.  
  
i'm genuinely convinced the uk gov could pass any bs law that serves the rich or conservative social beliefs and the masses wouldn't do anything. any actually disruptful act of protest to change it would be scowled upon by those who do nothing but complain about it at the dinner table.  
  
we should talk to those closest to us about our past and how we have the power. nobody wants to be forced to work 40hrs a week in a world that is deteriorating itself and nobody has to.  
  
going to a village would be great and align with your immediate values, but plsssss don't just leave it as "it's horrific and although change is possible, i'm not convinced it could be happen". i'm not saying you need to do anything serious, but externalise your education. you know that the powerful just have a monopoly on ideas. don't respect others oppressive ideas. we can't have an absolutist mindset on being nice and peaceful.there is no justice and maybe it's peaceful in our respective lives, horrific things are happening about
