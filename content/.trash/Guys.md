We fist bump
After bumping into one another 
In the highway of the house 
The foyer of the flat
You signed my cap
The shadow of the cat flap

After you were vomiting your guts out
While I was sprawled
All ova tha sofa
Not making da mosta (it)

Compulsive liar honest in the face of the state
Me, the opposite now I'm playin a new game 
Criss crossed with an x through my name
Can't you just help
Construction is the best destruction 
Compose on top of organic decomposition 
Sediment in the air, remedy is new sediment Somethin the top left often forget 
Feel like I can't leave it open ended
Without the wires being bent in whatever direction suits best (worst) Arts not place for those
Who are blinded by the clothes 
And see it through their own lense and jump to conclusions, encrypt it like nazi bullshit

Hard leftist revolutionary don't share your pits
But you must admit when the bush hairy
Shit is sweaty ain't merry
Takes a wizard or two to uninstall
Factory reset Joseph and Mary 

I don't usually speak like this, but neither do they

Nazi malware

Don't buy the one with the dented tin
Why, because the tin is dented

Pay attention 
I see you floating away 
Driftin in the other dimension 
Daydreams of being a campañon
Traveled down a tandoori tandom
To how I can write a zine
To get them kids fired up
Like a firework at night time
Before Halloween wouldn't be merry
But these things scary
...
How you just gonna air me 
tall temperature meant
somethin different for all
one thing to know about the afterglow
no temp employment by the tooth fairy
when the teeth fall out and the tongue hairy
grow weary where we go with contempt
Her ego collapse on top of your tent 
Brother be sent to phone an ambulance to cover your tone
Gotta stop smokin that home grown, chokin on that perspective you call your own
mopin up the stout with ket all up in your snout
Forget the night better yet all you known thats etched
isn't a virtue to be grown yet stretched
perplexed in a maze of tatoos
like a moose in the headlights
can't move, phone a fiend who bite the bed bug
covered in a ragged rug societal wreckage
smug smile with the anticapital message on the mug fetched from the 14 aisle
charlie sheen screamed helium lets follow mycelium
void voyager sets sail aboard the canabinoid derail
man stabbin freud still a kinder
mad not to strike a match with his mom on tinder
this dream lingers
what does it mean, what does it prove?
bad ketamine batch hinder his agility
swallowin the seeds sewn to the groove
"help soothe" on the cool bottle
cause to breathe is luxury in full throttle
borrow time from  the gold mine 
flash fuck struck us lucky
mold of a hollow tomorow of adultery
taboo like rubbery cutlery in the shrubbery of a nunnery
recovery of buttery hands is such a drudgery
often hides right infront of me like introductory 
Newly flowering pots sit at the front
oven crops reside at the back
Raised truely in the shadows 
Writ to face the brunt of the smack
out scouring the ground dissectin the maps, dismiss it as a new bird outta place in the meadow, floor of the metro
that towering sound makin your lemon curd 
was a red bright and blue drone
heard a third white mother moan gremlin true
im foaming at the mouth
whos steering the nautica, is it klaus is it you?
yankin the strings hanging out of my peers
direction abaqa
choppin us up like estaca in the trap     set out for the mouse
Sounds generous when you forget about all them cows you submitted   
Treason committed like no pasa nada
Sqeakin around their minds 
Tryna find a reason to justify their prada 
Necklace, thinking it'll leave their crush breathless
It's a cesspool of
common knowledge isn't common understandage
bombin and familiarity bump it to
6 for a college monopolised sandwich 
eastern diet riot bloated belly mix
roti 

bite the bullet, comb the mullet

law of averages created art that spread
eyes on hands off no red
rick, what the fuck? you make me sick
ill snap your dick instead 
new angle for every one you bled and strangle
hell is eternal so i wish you rabies
thermo used by your comrades before inferno

Hating oppression while rejecting the only means by which anyone has ever gotten free, is just a question guilt laundering

political conciounce of a teddy bear
those moans real or fake
fringe small and present 
annoying like mosquitos in the feather of a feasent
drapes down like an objectifed clown subject 
to sell dos amigos they make a lack of acid amino
moss in the cave of macosquin
pave your maze in your puzzles
the master and the slave align
takes a brave bastard to lend their time
amending a box to numbers one to nine







   

Still in the same mode as before
Just don't think about it no more
Gonna be sore of playing 
Need for weed
Will be freed once we all are
Shining like a black star
Hell I wouldn't blame the cane
For crushing you all the same
As the empirical candy floss
In the ass of your boss
Member of the glass class
Where you find the moss patch
Chillin like the frosties man

Colonizer's baby⁷ thinks she is indigenous. Bitch burn in the sun 
like butter melt up my bum

Publicly funded 
But only profits are privitized 
Cough it be there 
Cause the revolution won't be televised 
Make me aware 
Of this carnival circus fare
Of all this bullshit occupying the air 
How this won't change despite who's mayor
Fairer hare than turtle 
Fértil 
That activates my third eye
Not that activates my third leg
Beam of energy keeps me criss cross like mog and meg
Stock raised like stalks 
After we pull up our socks 
And cremate the system with foc
Ashes blown in flashes 
Dragging entropy through the  molasses 
Back to the graph we extrapolated 
To which everything was overrated 
Stated the very facts it needed to hide
Somewhere in a bucket full of pride
When I slide past an empty pair of hands
Beside a request to fill them with cans
Blame the black and tans
Uniform that is, I'm not racist 
Sometimes the value lies behind the face
But when theres no bitcoin miner
shit can't be deciphered
cant walk on wings
brings

Dark meat forearms grinding herb all night

Can't ignore the facsim that exists
Cause your not oppressed 

shoot the last shot f absynth 
quasi treatment turning this maze withhin a labrynth

said the photo was to be 9 mega or less
mines 9.2 i said fuck the passport and masturbated instead

Expandin my perspective beyond my own, smokin that home grown
